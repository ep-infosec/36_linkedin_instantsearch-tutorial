# Assignment 3
In this assignment we will be working to visualize the instant search results and the query autocomplete suggestions. We will be using the elasticsearch index and our midtier to search and retrieve the blended result set. 

### Prerequisites
This assignment requires the following to be running before proceeding further:
* Elasticsearch instance with Instant Search Results and Query Autocomplete index
* Python midtier for querying and blending the resultsets

### Verification
A typeahead interface has already been provided to you. Do the following steps and verify if you can see both instant search results and query suggestions.
* In your web browser open assignment3/excercise/stackexchange/typeahead/es.html
* Utilize the typeahead interface by typing queries and verifying the results.

### Congratulations
Congratulations ! You have setup an end-to-end working implementation of instant search results and autocomplete suggestions.
